Simple script to build a database of all the files in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Intentions are to build a basic image gallery that uses S3 as its primary (and only) source of images including thumbnails.

Usage:
Create a database with the schema in schema.sql.
Copy config.inc.php to config.php and alter the values accordingly.
